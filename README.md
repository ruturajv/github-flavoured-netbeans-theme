Installation
------------

1. Download the repo. Unzip the downloaded file and then manually create a

2. Open NetBeans, Go to Tools > Options. Click "Import" button in the bottom
   left and select the zip file created. Check "github" box in the Fonts and
   Colors section.

3. Restart NetBeans (just to be on the safe side). 

4. To use the new themes, go to Preferences, Fonts & Colors, and select either 
   of the two new themes from the Profile dropdown, and hit OK.
